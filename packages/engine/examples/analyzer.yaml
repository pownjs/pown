  title: Permissive Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
  description: >
    Cross-origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a specification, which allows
    Web applications the ability to offer its resources for public consumption
    from different domains. CORS is typically used in cross-origin APIs designed
    to be consumed by JavaScript applications.
